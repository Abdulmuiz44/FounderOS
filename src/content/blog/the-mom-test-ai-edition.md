# The Mom Test in the Age of AI: How to Do User Interviews Right

**Published:** February 4, 2026 | **Category:** Validation | **Reading Time:** 11 min

## The Problem with Customer Interviews

*"Would you use this?"*
*"Oh yeah, definitely! Great idea!"*

Two weeks later: No signups. No sales. Just crickets.

Sound familiar?

Rob Fitzpatrick's "The Mom Test" solved this problem in 2013 with one simple rule: **Ask about past behavior, not future hypotheticals.**

In 2026, we have AI that can help you script better questions, analyze sentiment, and identify patterns across dozens of interviews. Here's how to combine the timeless wisdom of The Mom Test with modern AI tools.

## The Core Mom Test Principles (Still True in 2026)

### Rule #1: Talk about their life, not your idea

**Bad:** "I'm building a tool that helps freelancers track time. Would you use it?"
**Good:** "How do you currently track your billable hours?"

**Why it works:** People lie about the future. They tell the truth about the past.

### Rule #2: Ask about specifics, not generalities

**Bad:** "Do you think this would be useful?"
**Good:** "Walk me through the last time you had to [solve this problem]. What did you do?"

**Why it works:** Vague

 questions get vague answers. Specific questions reveal actual pain.

### Rule #3: Listen more than you talk

**Bad:** 30-minute pitch + 5 minutes of questions
**Good:** 5-minute problem explanation + 25 minutes of listening

**Why it works:** You're trying to learn, not convince.

## How AI Supercharges The Mom Test

### AI Tool #1: Generate Unbiased Interview Questions

Use ChatGPT to create a question bank that follows Mom Test principles.

**Prompt:**
```
I'm validating a [product description]. Generate 20 Mom Test-style 
interview questions that:
1. Ask about past behavior, not future intent
2. Focus on specifics, not generalities
3. Reveal willingness to pay
4. Uncover current solutions and their costs
```

**Example output:**
- "Walk me through the last time you [faced this problem]"
- "How much time did that cost you?"
- "What have you tried to solve this?"
- "How much are you currently spending on [current solution]?"

### AI Tool #2: Sentiment Analysis of Interview Transcripts

Record your interviews (with permission) and use AI to analyze sentiment.

**Tools:**
- **Assembly AI** - Transcribe + sentiment analysis
- **ChatGPT** - Pattern identification
- **Claude** - Long-form analysis (100K context window)

**Upload transcript and ask:**
```
Analyze this customer interview transcript:
1. What pain points were mentioned?
2. How severe is the pain (1-10 scale based on emotional language)?
3. Are they actively spending money to solve this?
4. What specific words indicate buying intent vs. polite interest?
```

### AI Tool #3: Cross-Interview Pattern Detection

After 10+ interviews, use AI to identify patterns.

**Prompt:**
```
I've done 15 customer interviews about [problem]. Here are the transcripts.

Find:
1. Pain points mentioned by 50%+ of interviewees
2. Current solutions being used
3. Average spend on current solutions
4. Top feature requests
5. Red flags (people being polite but not actually interested)
```

This is what market research agencies charge $50K for. You can do it for free.

## The AI-Enhanced Interview Script

Here's a complete interview script that combines Mom Test principles with AI assistance:

### Opening (2 minutes)

"Thanks for chatting. I'm researching [problem space] and want to learn about your experience. This isn't a sales call—I'm genuinely just trying to understand how people like you deal with [problem]."

**AI assist:** Use ChatGPT to generate personalized opening based on the interviewee's background.

### Discovery Questions (15 minutes)

**Current Situation:**
1. "Walk me through how you currently [do the task]"
2. "How often do you deal with this?"
3. "Who else is involved in this process?"

**Past Behavior:**
4. "Tell me about the last time this was painful. What happened?"
5. "How much time did that cost you?"
6. "What did you try to fix it?"

**Money Questions:**
7. "Are you using any tools for this now? How much do they cost?"
8. "If there was a perfect solution, how much time/money would it save you?"
9. "What's your budget for tools in this category?"

**AI assist:** After each answer, use real-time AI (Claude or ChatGPT in another tab) to generate follow-up questions based on their response.

### Closing (3 minutes)

"Is there anything else about [problem] that frustrates you?"
"Who else should I talk to about this?"

**Don't pitch. Don't ask "would you pay." Just listen.**

### AI Tool #4: The "Bullshit Detector"

Upload your interview notes to AI and ask:

```
Based on this interview, is this person:
A) Actually experiencing pain and willing to pay
B) Being polite but not a real customer
C) Interested but not ready to buy

Explain your reasoning.
```

**Red flags AI will catch:**
- "That's interesting" (polite, not committed)
- "I might use that" (hypothetical, not real)
- "Neat idea!" (compliment, not commitment)

**Green flags AI will catch:**
- "I'm currently paying $X for this"
- "This costs me Y hours per week"
- "I've tried 3 different solutions"

## Real Example: How AI Helped Validate a $20K MRR SaaS

**The Idea:** Automated client reporting for marketing agencies.

### Traditional Interview (Failed)

**Founder:** "Would you pay for automated reporting?"
**Agency Owner:** "Oh yeah, definitely. I hate doing reports."
**Founder:** *builds product*
**Result:** 0 sales

### Mom Test + AI Interview (Success)

**Founder:** "How do you currently create client reports?"
**Agency:** "Excel. Takes 4 hours per client per month."

**Founder:** "How many clients?"
**Agency:** "12 clients."

**AI Analysis:** 
- Pain severity: 8/10 (strong emotional language: "hate," "waste," "tedious")
- Time cost: 48 hours/month
- Billing rate: $150/hour
- **Opportunity cost:** $7,200/month

**Founder:** "What have you tried to automate this?"
**Agency:** "Tried Supermetrics, Data Studio. Still manual. Paying $200/mo."

**AI Pattern Detection (across 20 interviews):**
- 18/20 agencies spending 40+ hours/month on reports
- Average spend on current tools: $150/month
- All would pay $400/month for true automation

**Launch Strategy:**
- Price: $399/month
- Target: Marketing agencies billing $10K+/month
- First month: 5 customers = $2K MRR
- Month 12: 50 customers = $20K MRR

## Common Interview Mistakes (Even with AI)

### Mistake #1: Asking leading questions

**Bad:** "Don't you think manual reporting is frustrating?"
**Good:** "What's the most time-consuming part of your job?"

**AI can't fix:** Your bias. It can only analyze what you ask.

### Mistake #2: Ignoring uncomfortable answers

**Interviewee:** "Actually, Excel works fine for us."
**Wrong response:** *Pivot to different pain point*
**Right response:** *Thank them and move on*

**AI value:** Helps you see patterns of "not actually painful

" across multiple interviews.

### Mistake #3: Talking to the wrong people

**Bad:** Interviewing your friends who "might use this someday"
**Good:** Finding people who are actively searching for solutions **right now**

**How to find them:**
- Reddit: Search for your problem, find people complaining
- Twitter: Advanced search for pain point keywords
- Slack/Discord communities in your niche
- LinkedIn: Filter by job title + years of experience

**AI assist:** Use ChatGPT to identify where your target customers hang out online.

## The 10-Interview Validation Test

After 10 interviews, you should know:

✅ **What the real pain is** (it's often not what you thought)
✅ **How people currently solve it** (and how much they pay)
✅ **Whether they're actively searching for alternatives**
✅ **What they'd actually pay** (not what they say, but what they spend now)

**If you can't answer these with confidence, do 10 more interviews.**

3. Record and transcribe (AI)
4. Analyze patterns (AI)
5. Build only if the pain is severe + they're already paying

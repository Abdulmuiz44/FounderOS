# FounderOS 🚀

**Don't just build. Build the right thing.**

FounderOS is the operating system for founders who want to stop wasting time on dead-end ideas. It flips the script from "Build -> Launch -> Fail" to "Generate -> Validate -> Execute".

## 🌟 Core Philosophy: Validate First

Most founders fail because they build something nobody wants. FounderOS forces you to:
1.  **Generate** high-potential ideas based on your unique "Founder DNA" & Unfair Advantages.
2.  **Validate** demand, competition, and monetization *before* writing a single line of code.
3.  **Execute** with focus, tracking real code progress via GitHub integration.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **Smart Generation:** AI generates tailored micro-SaaS and niche startup opportunities that fit *you*.
